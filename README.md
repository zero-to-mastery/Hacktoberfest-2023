**Following their success, we are excited to announce 3 projects for this year's Hacktoberfest:**

#### [![ASCII ART](https://img.shields.io/badge/PYTHON%20PROJECT-ASCII%20ART-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=Python)](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/ascii-art-2023)

Welcome to this years Python challenge for Hacktoberfest, A project with beginners and aspiring developers in mind, utilizing Python to convert images into ASCII Art.

ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable characters defined by the ASCII Standard from 1963 and ASCII compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters.

#### PROJECT INTRODUCTION

> Let's see how we can evolve the ASCII generator with our ZTM community help!! Maybe we want to display this on an HTML web page where users can submit images and we convert it to ASCII art? Maybe we want to improve how the Command Line Tool works/make it more customizeable? Or maybe modify the script to do many other types of art beyond ASCII.

The options are endless and there is no wrong answer. This is all for fun, so try to customize the tool whichever way you think would be best and let's see what we get at the end of the month! Enjoy!

# But how do I make a pull request/participate?

If you've never made a pull request before, or participated in an open-source project, we recommend taking a look at:

- Our [Start Here Guidelines](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines)
- Our [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQLNFRviB6Q).

These two resources have everything you need to learn about open-source, with a step-by-step guide to making your very first PR. Once you've got your feet wet, you're ready to come back and dive into Hacktoberfest fun!

# What happens after I make a pull request?

Simply speaking, your work is done. You can continue working and making pull requests on the same repo or work on something new.

Meanwhile, Hacktoberfest keeps track of all your pull requests. And, as mentioned above, you'll be eligible to get the Hacktoberfest digital reward once you successfully make 4 pull requests.

**Remember, you only need to make 4 pull requests to any of these open source projects in the month of October! Let's see if we can beat the record from last year!!**
